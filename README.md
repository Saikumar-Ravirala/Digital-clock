## 🛠 How It Works

- The `Date()` object is used to fetch the current time every second.
- A checkbox toggles the `_24` flag to determine the display format.
- Time is displayed in either `HH:MM:SS` (24-hour) or `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` (12-hour) format based on user input.
- The toggle switch UI includes dynamic label transitions ("12" and "24") for an intuitive experience.
